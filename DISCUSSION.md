I started this project around 1:00pm giving myself about 2 hours to complete. I initially started with the mock data and got most of the way through making the components separated for the table and search filters.

I then added in the backend to pull against the actual seeded database and found a few issues from that in the structure of the objects. After mapping those accordingly, I then made a few stylistic updates and added in the search and filter functionality to the backend making sure our frontend was updated to match.

At this point, I was just a bit over the 2 hour mark so I decided to stop there and submit what I had, but then tightened up the backend to submit what I would have been a solid deliverable.

I'm not sure if I'm missing anything from the assignment, but I'm happy with the outcome and the time I was able to spend on it. The drawers may have been a bit much, but figure the user won't be needing a reference to the specialties too often.

Happy to share the branch where I stopped right around the 2 hour mark if you'd like to see the process.

Thanks for the opportunity!
